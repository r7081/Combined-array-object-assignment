1. What is the default value of Array for different data types?
Ans:      Data type                                     Defafault Value
      byte,short,int,long                                       0
         float,double                                            0.0
          boolean                                                false
        Any object                                                null


2. Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
Ans: No, you can not pass the negative number as Array size. If you pass a negative number in Array size then you will not get the compiler error. Instead, you will get the NegativeArraySizeException at run time. 
3. Where does Array stored in JVM memory?
  Ans: Array is an object in java. So, Array is stored in heap memory in JVM. 
 4. What are the disadvantages of Array?
  Ans: To create an Array, contiguous memory is required. It is possible in JVM that the memory is available to accommodate Array but memory available is not contiguous. The Array is a static data structure. It is of fixed size. We can not increase or decrease the size of the Array after creation.
 5. What is an Anonymous Array in Java ? Give an example?
  An array without any name (or reference) is called an Anonymous Array. They are useful for the scenarios where we need one time usage of Array.   For example, Anonymous int array : new int[] {2,3,4,5,6,7}; Anonymous String array : new String[]{"Java , "Hungry"};
 6. What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java?
   Ans: Using for loop 
           Using for each loop
  7. What is the difference between length and length() method Give an Examples?
Ans:Ans: length An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of the same type. The length variable in an array returns the length of an array i.e. a number of elements stored in an array. Once arrays are initialized, its length cannot be changed, so the length variable can directly be used to get the length of an array. The length variable is used only for an array. 
Example: public class Test { public static void main(String args[]) { int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; System.out.println("Length of an array is: " + array.length); } } Output: Length of an array is: 7   length()
 The length() method is a static method of String class. The length() returns the length of a string object i.e. the number of characters stored in an object. String class uses this method because the length of a string can be modified using the various operations on an object. The String class internally uses a char[] array that it does not expose to the outside world. Example: public class Test { public static void main(String args[]) { String str = "Welcome to Tutorials Point"; System.out.println("Length of String using length() method is: " + str.length()); } }   Output: Length of String using length() method is: 26


OBJECTS
 1. How to create an object in java`?
  Ans:There are several ways by which we can create objects of a class in java as we all know a class provides the blueprint for objects, you create an object from a class. This concept is unIer-rateI anI soDetiDes proves to be beneficial as this concept is bypasseI by Dany prograDDers anI soDetiDes even I ask from interview perceptive.
Methods: 


There are Many Different ways to create objects in Java. the help of programs to illustrate internal working by
which we can create objects in Java
By Using new keyword
By Using new instance
By Using clone(5 DethoH
By Using Serialization;
By Using newInstance(method of Constructor class)
Let us Discuss theD one by one anI implement the saDe by appending a clean java program for the saDe.




Method 1: Using now keyword


Using the new keyword in java is the Most basic way to create an object. This is the Dost common way to create an object in java. Almost 99% of objects are createI in this way. y using this DethoI we can call any
constructor we want to call (no argument or parameterized constructors.
2. What is the use of a new keyword in Java`?
Ans: The "new" keyword in Java is used to create an instance of an object. It allocates DeDory to an object anI returns a reference to the object created. It is useI with a constructor to create an object.
 3. What are the different types of variables in Java?
Ans: Static Variables
         Instance Variables 
          Local Variables
4. What is the difference between Instance variables and Local variables`?
Ans:         Instance variable                                                           Local variables
      They are defined inside the class but                          They are defined as a type of variable
       outside the methods.                                                    Declared within programming blocks.
      
  These variables are destroyed when the object               These variables are destroyed when 
       is destroyed.                                                                 the constructor is exited.


  It can be accessed throughout the class.                              Its access is limited to the method 
                                                                                                          by which it is created.


5. In which area memory is allocated for instance variable and local variable?
Ans: Instance variables are allocated in the heap and local variables are allocated in the stack.


6. What is method overloading?
Ans: Method overloading in Java is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. The Java compiler distinguishes these methods by the number, type, and order of parameters. Overloading is used to provide multiple ways to call a method for different use cases, making code more readable and reusable.
